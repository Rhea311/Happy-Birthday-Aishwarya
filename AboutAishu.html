<h3><p>Aishwarya is a kind, calm, special, beautiful, organized, self-possessed young women of thirteen. 
        We as friends are extremely very lucky to have her. </p></h3>
        
        <h3><p>  One person who is never afraid to say a speech, declamation,
    whatever she does it's done with passion, love and joy. One person who is always ready to clarify doubts. One person 
who finishs their works before time. One person who is all techy! One person who is excellent in art and craft. 
One person with great memory and excellent in subjects at school.</p></h3>

<h3><p>I don't have to worry because I know she's got 
my back. She's always there when needed :) Not all friends have this quality but Aishu does. She's one in a million!
Friends protect you, they cover for you, they have fun with you, so many other things! Aishu has many of those!
I am very proud and glad to have a friend like Aishu. May her future be as bright as she is and may she stay blessed this 
year and have a awesome year ahead.
